# nvimconfig
This is my personal configuration for Nvim. Requires latest Nvim (if you use Ubuntu or some other Debian-based distro, use the unstable PPA, the stable one has given me problems). It has some nice things, like Telescope, Neotree, numbered lines, some shortcuts for formatting, fuzzy finding, grepping stuff, autopairing, snippets, a cool dashboard with custom quotes, and moar!
